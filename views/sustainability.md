## THE STANDARD

Sustainability is at the forefront of TARPLEY’s energy. Every garment, accessory, and experience starts with how we can create something positive for the earth with low impact. The materials we use to create with are the main path we see towards a positive fashion environment.

It is important to note that TARPLEY believes no fashion operation is truly “sustainable” in every facet of the business at this point and time. However, it is TARPLEY’s goal and commitment to achieve this result, and we will stop at no end in our pursuit.

Our first product, the X1 Dress, is made from ECONYL® regenrated nylon. ECONYL® is made by recovering nylon waste - such as fishing nets from the oceans and aquaculture, fabric scraps from mills and carpets destined for landfill - and turning it into virgin quality nylon yarn for fashion garments.
